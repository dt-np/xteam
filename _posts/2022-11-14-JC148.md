## Effect of Very High-Fluence Proton Radiation on 6H-SiC Photoconductive Proton Detectors

In this work, the effect of very high-fluence
100 MeV proton radiation on the performance of 6H-SiC
photoconductive proton detectors is studied. The irradia-
tion fluence is up to $$1.6\times10^{17}cm^{−2}$$ and the degradation
process of the SiC detector is continuously monitored
for the first time. Before proton irradiation, the detector
shows a low dark current of ∼ $$0.8 nA/cm^{2}$$ at 1000 V
bias. As the irradiation fluence increases, the dark current
continuously drops, which should be caused by irradiation
damage induced carrier compensation defects. Meanwhile,
the output current of the SiC detector shows an exponential
decay behavior and tends to saturate at irradiation fluence
up to $$5\times10^{16}cm^{−2}$$. At the end of the very high fluence
irradiation test, the detector still exhibits ∼20% of its original
output current value, suggesting the excellent radiation
hardness of SiC for proton detection.
